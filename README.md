# 🔄 Machine Unlearning

Machine unlearning is an emerging field in AI that explores how machine learning models can selectively forget specific training data while maintaining their overall performance. This capability is crucial for privacy-preserving AI, addressing data removal requests, and ensuring model adaptability without the computational burden of complete retraining.
